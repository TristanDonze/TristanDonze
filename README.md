## About Me
I'm currently pursuing a Master's degree at Institut Polytechnique de Paris, specializing in Artificial Intelligence. I'm actively seeking an internship opportunity to apply and expand my skills in this field.

## Areas of Interest

My primary focus lies in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Generative AI.  
The courses I am following this year are closely related to these areas:  

- **Advanced Deep Learning**: Building a solid foundation in deep learning techniques and applications.  
- **Sequence-to-Sequence Models for NLP and Speech Processing**: Mastering state-of-the-art techniques in NLP, including transformers and attention mechanisms.  
- **Generative & Multimodal AI**: Exploring generative AI (e.g., text-to-image generation, VAEs, diffusion models, stable diffusion), Vision Transformers, and self-supervised learning.  

## Future project
In order to code a 0.2b LLM, I'm currently studying the following paper : 

- [**Attention Is All You Need** ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03762)
- [**Language Models are Few-Shot Learners**](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.14165)

and I'm reading this book in parallel 
- [**Build a Large Language Model**](https://www.manning.com/books/build-a-large-language-model-from-scratch)
