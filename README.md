## About Me
I'm currently pursuing a Master's degree at Institut Polytechnique de Paris, specializing in Artificial Intelligence. I'm actively seeking an internship opportunity to apply and expand my skills in this field.

## Areas of Interest
While my primary focus lies in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and AI alignment, I enjoy exploring various aspects of AI to broaden my perspective.

## Current Coursework
This year, I'm diving deep into a diverse range of AI topics:

- **Advanced Deep Learning**: Building a solid foundation in deep learning techniques and applications.
- **Sequence-to-Sequence Models for NLP and Speech Processing**: Mastering state-of-the-art techniques in NLP, including transformers and attention mechanisms.
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Studying the foundations of RL, from Markov Decision Processes to Monte-Carlo tree search, with applications in games and recommender systems.
- **Computer Vision: from Fundamentals to Applications**: Exploring generative AI (image generation from text, VAE, Diffusion models, Stable Diffusion), Vision Transformers, and self-supervised learning.

## Current Reading List
Here's a list of Research Paper I'm currently reading, nothing really original here I'm starting with the basics ;)

- [**Attention Is All You Need** ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03762)
- [**TruthfulQA: Measuring How Models Mimic Human Falsehoods**](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.07958)
- [**Concrete Problems in AI Safety**](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.06565)

### And Books I'm using to follow courses 
- [**An Introduction To Statisical Learning**](https://www.statlearning.com/)
